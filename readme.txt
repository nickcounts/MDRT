Quickstart Guide:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------



To launch the MARS Review Tool, run 'review' at the command line, or 
right click 'review.m' and selet 'Run'.

Pre-requisites for happy data reviewing:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The review tool root path (where review.m lives) must be added to
MATLAB's path with all subfolders.

The tool needs a configuration file (review.cfg) to operate. It expects
to find this file in the tool's root path. If review.cfg is deleted, the
MARS Review Tool will generate a new, empty configuration and you will
have to set your working paths in the tool GUI and click "Save Path"

Any changes to the working path will need to be committed by clicking
"Save Path" in the Review GUI. Saving path will allow the data processing
tools to immediately operate in the new working paths.

EXCEPTION: Plot Setup GUI needs to be closed and relaunched to operate in
the new working path. (this will be addressed in future versions)

Fun Features:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many small helper functions in the "helpers" subdirectory. The
most commonly used are:

	*	boundaryMath([lowerLimit upperLimit], dataVector)

	*	trendMath(dataBrushVariable)

	*	ntegrateTotalFlow(dataBrushVariable, 'gpm')

	*	deltat(figureNumber)

These functions are intended to be paired with the data brushing tool.
Highlight the data you are interested in, right click and select "Create
Variable." The saved dataBrushVariable can be passed directly to
trendMath and integrateTotalFlow. 

boundaryMath requires a data vector only, so you need to pass
dataBrushVariable(:,2) to pass only the data portion, ignoring the time
vector.

deltat outputs the elapsed time between two markers placed on a figure. To
place a marker, select the "Data Cursor" tool in the plot toolbar. 
Clicking on a line will place a marker (you can drag and manipulate the 
marker after it is placed). Clicking again will move the marker to a new
location. To place additional markers, hold the "ALT" key while clicking.

Most plot attributes (text, data labels, line colors, styles, etc) can be
modified by selecting the "Edit Plot" tool (looks like a white arrow) in
the toolbar. Double clicking an object will bring up a property editing
toolbar. To edit a different aspect of the plot, simply click on the item
while the edit pane is active.

Saving Plots:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plots generated by QuickPlot don't save in a very pretty way. Screenshots
may be the best option. If a better save is needed, use 
"orient('landscape')" first to fix a known rendering issue. Then use
"saveas(figureNumber, 'path/filename', 'pdf')" - pdf and jpg are both 
good options.

Saving plots made from the plot setup tool (multi subplot gui) is much
easier and looks much better. Use the "Save Figure" toolbar button 
(the floppy disk) to bring up the save dialog. "pdf" is the default option
and produces usable results.

Using the File -> Save menu option allows saving the figure as a .fig file.
This preserves all the contents of a figure in an editable form, so you can
return to the figure and modify it in the future.
